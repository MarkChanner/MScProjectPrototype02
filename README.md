Prototype 02 for MSc Project - First Android Version

##Introduction
This is the second prototype of a tile matching game designed with the idea of helping children with autism  
to read people's facial expressions. Whereas MScProjectPrototype01 was coded in Java, this version has been   
coded in Android. However, much of the underlying logic of the game is reused from the Java version with  
only minor changes necessary. 

This second prototype, like the first, features 5 emoticons. The images of the emoticons are temporary for
this version. I am concious of the importance of the images: If they are too realistic, it will not only look
creepy, but children will not be as inclined to play it. On the other hand, if the cartoon images do not depict
the emotion well, it will not help the children to identify the expression on a real person's face.

I still plan to introduce extra functionality in later prototypes, in addition to some basic requirements 
that are not yet implemented, such as a score board. In order to introduce a wider range of emotions than 
the five given so far, I would like to implement levels with emoticons of more advanced emotions as the 
game goes on. I also need to implement a way for the board to reset if there are no possible matches left. 

##Testing
The game has been tested (i.e played) by myself, different family members and friends for altogether many  
hours, and this has been very valuable. Of course, I am aware that this is not enough and need to introduce
automated testing as was in the first prototype.
